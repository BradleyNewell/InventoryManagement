# InventoryManagement
The aim of this project is to provide a valid alternative to barcodes and serial numbers which is extremely user friendly.
To achieve this goal the script utilises a file comprised of over 450k words to generate strings of 4 randomly selected words, it will then
check for occurrence in the default saved_items.txt file so no duplicates will be returned

Basic Guide:
In order to change the text the words are pulled from, see line 4 and change the 1st argument to the file name you wish to use.
Similarly to change the file name you wish to write to or to write to an existing file please change the 1st argument on line 5.

To change the amount of words returned, please change the value in line 18 to desired.

please note, this software will most likely be an evolving project and some features may change and some new ones will inevitably be
added.
